                    <h1>Kaseya Launches Innovative Refresh of its Global Channel and Alliance Program</h1>

                    <p class="intro">
                        Company Invests Heavily in the Channel and Adds Two New Channel Executives
                    </p>


                    <p><strong>BOSTON – May 8, 2014</strong> – Kaseya, the leading provider of cloud-based IT management software today announced a newly enhanced Kaseya Partner Program with powerful new tools and resources for technology solutions providers to grow their businesses. As members of the Kaseya Partner Program, authorized partners are equipped with the incentives, training, marketing and support they need to capitalize on the significant revenue opportunities that exist through selling, customizing and supporting Kaseya solutions around the globe.</p>

                    <p>To further Kaseya’s investment in building and supporting a vibrant and successful partner community, the company also recently brought on two seasoned channel executives – Roger Hodskins as head of global channels and alliances and Andrew Robinson as head of the EMEA channel organization. Both executives bring extensive channel management experience and will focus on growing existing partnerships and developing new ones to extend Kaseya’s reach and strengthen distribution channels worldwide.</p>

                    <p>The Kaseya Partner Program includes a wealth of resources to make partners’ jobs easier and help them to grow their businesses including:</p>

                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li>Tiered rewards and incentives for reselling Kaseya solutions</li>
                        <li>An innovative Partner Portal that includes a rich set of business and technical resources, as well as deal registration, lead management capabilities, and community discussion groups</li>
                        <li>Tailored sales training, marketing materials, and technical documentation that include dedicated sales, pre-sales and support resources</li>
                        <li>Reseller tools for on-boarding new customers, provisioning end-users, offering demos and proof-of-concept assistance , and pipeline management and forecasting</li>
                        <li>API integration for easy web programming and access</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>“We’ve been working with Kaseya for many years and have benefited from an extremely close relationship,” Says Andrea Veca, CEO of Achab IT, a Kaseya channel partner located in Italy. “The new initiatives Kaseya is rolling out for the channel will increase the efficiency of our cooperation and I am confident that this will help us to continue our business growth. 2013 was our best year ever but 2014 is already looking even better and with Kaseya’s new partner resources and upcoming product releases, we will be able to enable considerably more companies to take advantage of the value delivered by Kaseya.”</p>

                    <p>“Experiencing first-hand the immense business opportunity with Kaseya, we have expanded our partnership as not only a Distributor, but also as a Third Party Integrator,” comments Adnil Puente, Director of Sales for NM Network Manager Sales Inc., a Kaseya authorized Philippine Distributor. “Based on the highly positive feedback from our clients, we are very motivated to invest further in our Kaseya relationship, and we are confident that this will enable us to have another great year in 2014.”</p>

                    <p>“Kaseya has now redoubled its efforts to invest in enabling partners and expanding our offerings with and through the partner community,” said Roger Hodskins, vice president of global channels and alliances for Kaseya. “Our partners today deliver significant value through certified implementation services, unique consulting skills, integration with complementary products, and more. We see the expansion of our global channel program as vital to accelerating Kaseya’s growth by providing increased flexibility and resources for our customers.”</p>
